# rat-window

This can manage and render windows in the terminal.

- Supports Box<dyn T> widgets to render.
- Those are stateful widgets too.
- Can forward events to those.

## State

Currently only moving the windows is implemented.
There is only one simple window style.

But the traits look ok and the mechanics seem to work.

So there is some detail implementation missing, and
a few thoughts about the actual api.

## Future

This is stalled for now because of other projects.
But I will watch the issues sometimes.
